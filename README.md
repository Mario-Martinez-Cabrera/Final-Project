# Final-Project

This is the capstone of the Back-End Developer professional certificate by Meta. 

We create a fictional restaurant named Little Lemon with the following steps.
We create a Django project and set up the static routes to serve static content using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
Using MySQL, we code the models and API using Django rest framework. 
The front end queries and interacts with the table reservation API to send and retrieve data from a MySQL database.
Using the Django rest framework, we implement the menu API to return a list of food menu items.

We add token authentication with Djoser. We implement TokenAuthentication feature of Django REST frame work 
to add a registration page, add the login page, add the log out functionality, and secure table booking API. 
We perform unit tests to the models and views by creating test_models.py and test_views.py files. We test
the API using Insomnia.
